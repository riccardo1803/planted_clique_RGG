The notebook contains code related to the paper "Planted clique recovery in random geometric graphs".
Authors: K. Avrachenkov, A. Bobu, N. Litvak, R. Michielan

It contains:
- Functions to determine (qualitatively) the phase transition for success/failure of the VD- or CN-algorithm, as indicated in the paper.
- Functions to generate random geometric graphs (RGG), implementation of the VD-algorithm and the CN-algorithm.
- Numerical experiments showing the accuracy of the algorithms.
